# What is this?

This example uses donmccurdy's aframe-extras library to place environment cubemaps on your glb models.

'cube-env-map-gl.js' is a slightly modified version of 'cube-env-map.js' that works with glitch's asset hierarchy. Please use the [original](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/master/src/misc/cube-env-map.js) if not on glitch.
